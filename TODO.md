* Product resource
   * Add index view
   * Indicate to user whether product was successfully created
   * Add testing?
   * Remove unused routes and files
* Add association methods to models (what do I need at this point?)
* Consider adding stricter validation for models (such as permitting only lowercase characters in name fields)
* Add ShoppingList model
* Flesh out models
* Create web interface so that I can input products, units, items, and dishes through a GUI rather than just the command line (use downshift?)
* Add linter
