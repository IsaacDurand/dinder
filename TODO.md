* Add association methods to models (what do I need at this point?)
* Add unit tests for model validation (with rspec?)
* Consider adding stricter validation for models (such as permitting only lowercase characters in name fields)
* Add ShoppingList model
* Flesh out models
* Create web interface so that I can input products, units, items, and dishes through a GUI rather than just the command line
